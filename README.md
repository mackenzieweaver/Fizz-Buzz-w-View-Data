# Fizz-Buzz-w-View-Data

![Fizz Buzz MVC](https://github.com/mackenzieweaver/FizzBuzzMVC/blob/main/FizzBuzzMVC/fizzbuzzmvc.png)

### Why did I make Fizz Buzz, again... ?

The main difference here is that this fizz buzz application was built with ASP.NET Core MVC.

### The live site

The site is not live because it has not been hosted and/or deployed anywhere.
